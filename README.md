This project is a reulst of the project course in medical engineering at KTH

You need to install all the packages from the requirements.txt as well as the ones in the dependencies folder. This can be done manually or with the bash or batch skrips install_packages_... A venv is recommended. If this is a new concept to you watch the video by corey shaefer for [unix][1] or [windows][2] respectively.

Installation process for unix:
1) clone repository to a local path
2) create a venv if desired (recommended)
3) make the install_packages_unix.sh executable: `chmod +x install_packages.sh`
4) run the bash skript with: `sh install_packages_unix.sh`

Installation process for windows:
1) clone repository to a local path
2) create a venv if desired (recommended)
3) I haven't wrote a batch skript for windwos yet but it will follow. You can always install the packages manually if you know how it works.
